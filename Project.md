The ‘Amphiencode' project gathers several labs around the goal to build an extensive functional genomics ressource for the european amphioxus *Branchiostoma lanceolatum*.  
 The first step of this project has been to establish a high quality assembly and annotation for this species (see [data](http://amphiencode.github.io/Data) with the participation of the [Génoscope](http://genoscope.cns.fr) and the support of [France Génomique](http://france-genomique.org). 
The second step consists in applying state-of-the-art regulatory profiling techniques to several tissues and emnbryonic stages in this species. Datasets have now been generated with techniques such as ATAC-seq, Chip-seq and chromatin conformation capture (3C).
